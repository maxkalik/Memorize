    /// All our views could have pointers to it
    /// So since you will have many of view - they will look through this "portal" (class) into the model
    
    // But it could be a problem
    /// Lots of people are pointing to the same ViewModel. They can mess it up. It ruins the party for everybody.
    /// for example we can have here a global var Model which will give an access to change something in the Whole Model
    /// it will cause messing up because we can change something we have not to change
    /// so in other words the model could be like opened door
